# Authentication Guard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds authentication guards to protect admin routes in the RNR Fitness Gym Flutter application. When users try to access admin pages without being logged in, they will be automatically redirected to the admin login page.

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/services/auth_guard.dart` (New File)
- **AuthGuard**: Generic authentication guard that checks user authentication status
- **AdminAuthGuard**: Specific guard for admin routes
- **CustomerAuthGuard**: Specific guard for customer routes (for future use)
- **Loading Screen**: Shows while authentication is being verified

### 2. `lib/main.dart`
- Added import for `auth_guard.dart`
- Wrapped all admin routes with `AdminAuthGuard`:
  - `/admin-dashboard`
  - `/admin-statistics`
  - `/admin-trainers`
  - `/admin-customers`
  - `/admin-products`

## How It Works

1. **Route Protection**: When a user navigates to any admin route (e.g., `/#/admin-statistics`), the `AdminAuthGuard` checks:
   - If the user is logged in (`unifiedAuthState.isLoggedIn`)
   - If the user has admin privileges (`unifiedAuthState.userType == UserType.admin`)

2. **Authentication Check**: The guard listens to the `unifiedAuthState` for real-time authentication status updates.

3. **Redirect Logic**: If the user is not authenticated or not an admin:
   - Shows a loading screen with "Verifying access..." message
   - Automatically redirects to `/admin-login` page
   - Clears the navigation stack to prevent back navigation

4. **Loading States**: 
   - Shows loading screen while auth state is initializing
   - Shows loading screen while redirecting unauthenticated users

## Protected Routes

All admin routes are now protected:
- `/admin-dashboard` - Admin profile/dashboard
- `/admin-statistics` - Statistics page
- `/admin-trainers` - Trainers management
- `/admin-customers` - Customers management  
- `/admin-products` - Products management

## User Experience

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. User types `localhost:50155/#/admin-statistics` in browser
2. App shows loading screen with "Verifying access..."
3. User is automatically redirected to admin login page
4. User must log in with admin credentials to access the page

### For Authenticated Admin Users:
1. User navigates to any admin route
2. App verifies authentication status
3. User is granted access to the requested page

## Testing

To test the authentication guard:

1. **Without Login**:
   - Open browser and go to `localhost:50155/#/admin-statistics`
   - Should be redirected to login page

2. **With Login**:
   - Login as admin first
   - Navigate to any admin route
   - Should have access to the page

## Future Enhancements

- Add role-based access control for different admin permissions
- Add session timeout handling
- Add remember me functionality
- Add customer route protection if needed
