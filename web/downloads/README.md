# Rnr Gym APK Placeholder

Place the signed Android package that you want visitors to download in this
folder and rename it to `rnr_gym.apk`. The download button in the landing page
expects that exact filename and will present it to users as `Rnr Gym.apk`.

> Tip: keep this README or a `.gitkeep` alongside the APK so the folder stays
> part of source control even when the build output is cleaned.
